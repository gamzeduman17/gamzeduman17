I'm a Software Developer and for a long time I've wanted to start programming. In the last one year, I've got the opportunity to focus on learning, practicing and developing. It changed my life completely!
I've always been a curious person who loves to learn 🔍 and I'm that person who always want to create thus it thought me here. 

I have a bachelor's degree on Mathematics 🧮 and I previously on teaching Math, so it naturally when I came to programming I love to understand the intensity of a problem and also provide a chunk of ways to solve it 🤟🏻

I also like movies, canvas drawing, sculpting, books 💞
